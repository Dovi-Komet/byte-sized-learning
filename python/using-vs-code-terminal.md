The terminal is a powerful tool for interacting with your computer and running Python code. Let’s learn how to use it.

### Opening the Terminal in VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + ~` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + ~` (Mac) to open the terminal.
3. Alternatively, you can go to the top menu, click on **View**, and select **Terminal**.

### Using the Terminal

- **Navigate Directories**:
  - To list files in the current directory, type:
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
  - To change directories, type:
    ```bash
    cd folder_name
    ```

- **Run Python Code**:
  - Type `python` or `python3` (depending on your installation) to start the Python interpreter.
  - Exit the interpreter by typing:
    ```python
    exit()
    ```

In the next lesson, we’ll write and run our first Python program!
