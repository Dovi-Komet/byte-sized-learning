Now that your environment is set up, let's write and run your first Python program.

### Step 1: Create a Python File

1. Open VS Code.
2. Create a new file by clicking **File** > **New File**.
3. Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `first_program.py`.

### Step 2: Write Your Code

In your Python file, type the following code:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code tells Python to display the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

### Step 3: Run Your Code

1. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~` or `Cmd + ~`).
2. Navigate to the folder where your Python file is saved using the `cd` command.
3. Run your program by typing:

   ```bash
   python first_program.py
   ```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Python program.
