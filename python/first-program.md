# First Program

Congratulations on setting up your environment and learning to use the terminal! Now, let's write and run your very first Python program.

---

### Step 1: Create a Python File

1. Open your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Create a new file and save it as `first_program.py`. Make sure the file extension is `.py`, as this indicates a Python file.

---

### Step 2: Write Your Code

Add the following code to `first_program.py`:

```python
# This is my first Python program
print("Hello, World!")
```

---

### Step 3: Run Your Program

1. Open the terminal in your code editor or your system's terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where `first_program.py` is saved using the `cd` command.
3. Run the program with the following command:

```bash
python first_program.py
```

You should see the output:

```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

### Step 4: Experiment

Try modifying your program to display a different message. For example:

```python
print("Welcome to Python programming!")
```

Run your program again and observe the changes in the output.

### Key Takeaways

- The `print()` function is used to display text or other data on the screen.
- Python files are saved with a `.py` extension.
- You can run Python programs from the terminal using the `python` command.
