In Python, variables are used to store information that you can use and manipulate later. Let's learn about variables and their data types.

## What is a Variable?

A variable is like a container that holds data. You can assign a value to a variable using the `=` symbol.

### Example

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
```

Here:
- `name` is a variable holding the text "Alice."
- `age` is a variable holding the number 25.

## Common Data Types in Python

1. **Strings**: Used for text. Strings are enclosed in quotes (`" "` or `' '`).
   ```python
   greeting = "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. **Integers**: Used for whole numbers.
   ```python
   number = 10
   ```

3. **Floats**: Used for decimal numbers.
   ```python
   pi = 3.14
   ```

4. **Booleans**: Represent True or False values.
   ```python
   is_happy = True
   ```

## Printing Variables

You can print variables to see their values:

```python
print(name)
print(age)
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Alice
25
```
