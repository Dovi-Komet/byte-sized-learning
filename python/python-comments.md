Comments are lines in your code that are ignored by Python. They are useful for explaining your code or leaving notes for yourself and others.

## Single-Line Comments

Start a comment with the `#` symbol. Everything after `#` on that line is ignored by Python.

### Example

```python
# This is a comment
print("Comments are ignored by Python")
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Comments are ignored by Python
```

## Multi-Line Comments

To write longer comments, you can use multiple `#` symbols or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).

### Example

```python
'''
This is a multi-line comment.
It spans multiple lines.
'''
print("Multi-line comments are also ignored by Python")
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Multi-line comments are also ignored by Python
```

Use comments to make your code easier to understand!
