Boolean logic is the foundation of decision-making in Python. It allows you to evaluate expressions as `True` or `False`.

## Boolean Operators

1. **AND**: Returns `True` if both conditions are `True`.
2. **OR**: Returns `True` if at least one condition is `True`.
3. **NOT**: Inverts the boolean value.

### Example: Basic Boolean Operators

```python
a = True
b = False

print(a and b)  # False
print(a or b)   # True
print(not a)    # False
```

Boolean logic is a critical concept that will be used in later lessons to make decisions in code. Mastering these basics will help you as we explore more complex topics like conditionals and loops.
