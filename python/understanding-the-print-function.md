In the last lesson, we used the `print()` function. Letâ€™s take a closer look at how it works.

### What is the `print()` Function?

The `print()` function is used to display information on the screen. You can use it to show text, numbers, or even the results of calculations.

### Example 1: Printing Text

```python
print("Welcome to Python!")
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
Welcome to Python!
```

### Example 2: Printing Numbers

```python
print(123)
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
123
```

### Example 3: Printing Results of a Calculation

```python
print(10 + 5)
```

### Expected Output

```plaintext
15
```

The `print()` function is a fundamental tool in Python and will be used throughout this course.
