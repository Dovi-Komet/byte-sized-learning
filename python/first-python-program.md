Now that your environment is set up, let's write and run your first Python program.

## Step 1: Write Your Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Create a new file by clicking **File** > **New File**.
3. In the new file, type the following code:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

   This code tells Python to display the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.

## Step 2: Save Your File

1. Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `first_program.py`.
2. Choose a folder where you want to save your file. Remember this location as you'll need it to run the program.

## Step 3: Run Your Code

1. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + ~` on Mac).
2. Navigate to the folder where your Python file is saved. Use the `cd` command with a relative or full path. For example:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\YourName\Documents
   ```
3. Run your program by typing:
   ```bash
   python first_program.py
   ```

## Expected Output

```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You've written and executed your first Python program.
