# Setup Environment

Before we can start coding in Python, we need to set up our development environment. This lesson will guide you through the process of installing Python and setting up a code editor.

---

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. During installation, **ensure that you check the box** to "Add Python to PATH."

To verify the installation:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Type the following command and press Enter:

    ```python
    python --version
    ```

   This should display the installed Python version.

### Step 2: Install a Code Editor

We recommend using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Install the application on your computer.
3. Launch VS Code and install the **Python extension** for syntax highlighting, debugging, and more:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
   - Search for "Python" and install the extension by Microsoft.

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

1. Open VS Code.
2. Create a new file and save it as `test.py`.
3. Add the following code:

    ```python
    print("Hello, Python!")
    ```

4. Open the terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or Cmd+`` on macOS).
5. Run the script with the following command:

    ```python
    python test.py
    ```

You should see the output:

```plaintext
Hello, Python!
```
