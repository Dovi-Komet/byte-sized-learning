# Setup Environment

Before we dive into Python programming, we need to set up your development environment. This includes installing Python and choosing a code editor.

## Installing Python

1. **Download Python**:
   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"}.
   - Download the latest version for your operating system.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Run the installer.
   - Make sure to check the box that says **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation.
   - Follow the installation prompts.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Type the command:  
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Python version.

## Choosing a Code Editor

A code editor is where you'll write your Python code. Here are some popular options:

- **VS Code** (Recommended):  
  - Download from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.
  - Install the Python extension for syntax highlighting and debugging.

- **PyCharm**:  
  - Ideal for larger Python projects.
  - Download from [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/){:target="_blank"}.

- **Other Options**: Sublime Text, Atom, or even a simple text editor.

## Setting Up VS Code for Python

1. **Install VS Code**:
   - Download and install from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.

2. **Install the Python Extension**:
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
   - Search for "Python" and install the extension by Microsoft.

3. **Verify the Setup**:
   - Open a new file and save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `hello.py`).
   - Type the following code:
     ```python
     print("Hello, Python!")
     ```
   - Run the file by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B` or using the Run option.

## Testing Your Setup

1. Open a terminal in your code editor.
2. Navigate to the folder where your Python file is saved.
3. Run the file with:
   ```bash
   python hello.py
   ```
4. You should see the output:
   ```
   Hello, Python!
   ```

Now that your environment is ready, you're all set to begin your Python journey!
