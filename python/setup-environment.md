## Setting Up Your Python Development Environment

Before we start coding, you need to set up your development environment to work with Python. Follow these steps to install Python and a code editor.

### Step 1: Install Python

1. Visit the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Download the latest version of Python for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and ensure the **Add Python to PATH** option is selected during installation.
4. Verify the installation by opening a terminal and typing:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

   If you’re on macOS or Linux, you might need to use `python3` instead:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

#### What to Expect:
When you run this command, you should see output similar to the following:

```plaintext
Python 3.x.x
```

The `3.x.x` will be replaced with the version number of Python you installed. If you see an error or no version number, Python may not be installed correctly.

#### How to Open a Terminal:
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter`.
- **macOS**: Press `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press `Enter`.
- **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` or search for "Terminal" in your applications menu.

### Step 2: Install VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a free and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft. It is widely used by developers because of its simplicity, speed, and powerful features. With VS Code, you can:

- Write and edit code in various programming languages.
- Use built-in tools like the terminal and debugger.
- Extend functionality with a wide range of extensions.

To install VS Code:

1. Visit the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Download and install the version for your operating system.
3. During installation, select the options to add VS Code to your system path for easy access.

### Step 3: Install the Python Extension for VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Click on the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for "Python" and install the extension provided by Microsoft.
